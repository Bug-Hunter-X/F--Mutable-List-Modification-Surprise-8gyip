The behavior observed in the `bug.fs` file isn't technically a bug; it's how mutable lists behave in F#. When you modify an element of a mutable list, you're modifying the element *in place*. Since lists are reference types (even though the elements might be value types), the reference to the modified list remains the same.  Both the original list and the returned list point to the same underlying data structure.

To avoid unexpected changes in the original list, it is often better to work with immutable lists. Alternatively, if mutability is required, consider cloning the list before making changes or creating a new list and returning it, thus avoiding side effects:

```fsharp
let mutable y = [1;2;3]

let addOneToFirst y = 
    let newList = y |> List.map (fun x -> if x = y.[0] then x + 1 else x)
    newList

let result2 = addOneToFirst y
printf "%A %A" y result2 //This will print [1;2;3] [2;2;3]
```

This approach ensures that the original list remains unchanged and avoids the potential for unexpected side effects.
